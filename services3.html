             	<h3>Description</h5>
             	<p>
                 At its press conference on December 8, 2018, the Komite 13 Oktob ('K13O') introduced the Citizen Primary - an open, democratic and transparent model where citizens could choose their candidates. Citizens had the opportunity to send suggestions / proposals to improve the process until 26 December. The K13O had received several proposals that helped finalize the model.<p>

                 <p>The K13O launched the Citizen Primary officially on January 10, 2019 and more than 76 citizen candidates submitted their applications through its website www.ensamcitoyens.com. Subsequently, a committee of wise men, with different non-political profiles, validated the applications.

                 <p>More than 30 working meetings have been completed since the launch of the citizen primary. At the national convention with the candidates registered on March 30, 2019, the candidate-citizens elected the executive bureau, validated the name of the party and the party structure.

                 <p>This is a first in the political history of the country where a political formation was created by a process of participative democracy, resulting from a citizens' initiative.

                  <p>A new political party was founded bearing the name<strong> '100% Citizens'</strong> .

                  <p>Party values ​​are based on three main <strong>pillars</strong>,<strong> integrity</strong> , <strong>proactivity</strong> and <strong>synergy</strong> . It is a party that has been created<strong> by citizens and for citizens.</strong>

                   <p>We are seeking your help to secure the necessary financial resources for the party's civic activities for the upcoming legislative elections.

                  <p>Thank you very much for your support.</p>
