             	<h3>Description</h5>
             	<p>
                  This project led by the association of Women Entrepreneurs Réunies (FER) of Beau-Bassin / Rose-Hill, whose president is Isabelle Abia, aims to improve the quality of bags and clothing made by the twenty or so member entrepreneurs. the association by strengthening their production capacity through the acquisition of industrial sewing machines and computer equipment.</p>
                 <p>
                 These industrial machines will allow those who manufacture the bags to vary the models by offering different textures thicker and therefore more resistant and better quality, and those who make clothes to have a more professional finish. Hence the acquisition of two types of industrial machinery. As labeling is an important element, the purchase of a machine is necessary.</p>
                    <p>
                 Relying on their reputation, FER members are working more and more with companies that outsource orders to them. The computer hardware and the multi-purpose printer will improve communication with their suppliers, customers and stakeholders.</p>
